# App1MobileAppDev
App 1 for CS 4530 mobile app development class

- App takes in first, middle, and last names. You can also take a picture, which is displayed as a thumbnail.
- Upon submit, it takes you to another activity which continues displaying your picture as a thumbnail as well as your name.
- The app correctly stores data persistently (at least for the session), so even if the app is rotated, or is paused and then resumes, it should still display the image and names on the screen.
